"""
This is a simple speech recognition program that predicts which phone a given sound input is.
After reading in training sound files, we train the acoustic model using modified Baum-Welch 
algorithm for speech recognition.Then we used the acoustic model to predict phones for a test set.

This program runs with Python2.7 and depends many packages. Please make sure you have downloaded all packages
before running the program
